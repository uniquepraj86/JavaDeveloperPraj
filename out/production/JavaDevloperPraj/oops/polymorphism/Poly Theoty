Types of polymorphism:

1. Compile-time polymorphism or static polymorphism - method overloading(achieve)
2. Run time polymorphism (Dynamic Method dispatch) or Dynamic polymorphism - method overriding(achieve)

poly -> many
morph -> forms

eg. 1. water - solid -ice, liquid -water, gas -vapour
    2. sound - dog -bark, lion -roar, cat -meow

Note: Runtime polymorphism can't achieved by data members


 Method Overloading            Method Overriding
 1. same name                    1. same name
 2. same class                   2. diff class
 3. diff no. of args             3. same no. of args,must have same parameters,return type must be same
 4. diff data types              4. when two classes have is-a relationship(inheritance)

 class A{
 void show(String n){}
 }
 class B extends A{

 void show(String n){}
 }

 polymorphism - the ability to take one form tomany forms.
 Methodolodding- same name but different number of arguments.


 rules-
 1) changing no of arguments
 2) changing the function datatype


Methodoverridding - same name but different class.
